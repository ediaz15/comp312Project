# Mission Statement

The mission of the FreshBooker project is to create a simple, clean, and accessible haircut booking web application that demonstrates the fundamentals of web application design and development.

This project prioritizes ease of use, clear navigation, and an intuitive user experience. The goal is not to replicate the full functionality of commercial booking platforms, but to provide a realistic prototype that shows how users might interact with a scheduling system in a real-world scenario.

FreshBooker was designed as a learning-focused project, emphasizing clean code structure, modular design, and teamwork while applying concepts from the course.
